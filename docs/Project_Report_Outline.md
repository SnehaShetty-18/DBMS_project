# Alumni Networking & Mentorship System - Project Report

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Problem Statement
Students often struggle to connect with seniors or alumni for career guidance. Alumni want to give back (mentorship, internships, job referrals) but there's no structured system. A DBMS can manage these connections efficiently.

### 1.2 Objectives
- Create a platform for students to connect with alumni
- Facilitate mentorship relationships
- Enable alumni to post internship opportunities
- Provide a communication system between users
- Implement a feedback mechanism for mentorship experiences

### 1.3 Scope
The system will focus on:
- User registration and authentication
- Profile management for students and alumni
- Mentorship request system
- Internship posting and application system
- Messaging system for communication
- Feedback and rating system
